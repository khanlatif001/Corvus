Input Structure

The input of Corvus is very simple: All input variables (i.e. tokens) have the
following possible structures:

################################################################################
! comment
token1 {value} # comment
token2 {value value value}
token3 {
        value  # comment
        value  ! comment
       }
token4  value
################################################################################

Each token can be followed by a single value, or by a group of values enclosed
in curly brackets. Any input in a line after the "!" or "#" characters is
considered a comment.

Depending on the input variable, the values must have the following possible
types:

Integer: Any integer number, for example, 42, -10, 0, 1

Float:   Any real number, for example, -10.0, 20.5, -1.0e+10

Boolean: A logical value with the possible values of 0, 1, True, False, .true.,
         .false., T and F

String:  A string is a collection of alphanumeric characters without any spaces,
	 basically any other value that is not an Integer, Float or Boolean.

In addition to these types, Corvus has two other possible types that are
important for developers as they affect the internal handling of the data:

Auto:    This type indicates that Corvus will attempt to determine the type of
         the data automatically.

Pass:    The data is passed to the Handlers "as is" (i.e. as a string with
	 exactly the same formatting that is put between the curly brackets).

Below you can find a description of all of the available input tokens in Corvus.
